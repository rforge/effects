\usage{data(Wells)}
\format{
  A data frame with 3020 observations on the following 5 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{switch}}{whether or not the household switched to
      another well from an unsafe well: \code{no} or \code{yes}.}
    \item{\code{arsenic}}{the level of arsenic contamination in the 
      household's original well, in hundreds of micrograms per liter; all
      are above 0.5, which was the level identified as ``safe''.}
    \item{\code{distance}}{in meters to the closest known safe well.}
    \item{\code{education}}{in years of the head of the household.}
    \item{\code{association}}{whether or not any members of the household
      participated in any community organizations: \code{no} or \code{yes}.}
  }
}

\details{
  The data are for an area of Arahazar upazila, Bangladesh.
  The researchers labelled each well with its level of arsenic and an
  indication of whether the well was ``safe'' or ``unsafe.'' Those using unsafe
  wells were encouraged to switch. After several years, it was determined
  whether each household using an unsafe well had changed its well. 
  These data are used by Gelman and Hill (2007) for a logistic-regression example.
